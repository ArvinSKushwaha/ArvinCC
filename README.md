# C Compiler

This here is a small toy C compiler. :) It is currently very nonfunctional.

Progress:

- [X] Implement a tokenizer
- [ ] Parse tokens into AST
- [ ] Convert AST into assembly
- [ ] Write simple assembler? Maybe just use another one like LLVM-AS or GAS or NASM
- [ ] Linker magic hehee

Indefinitely far goals:

- [ ] Optimization passes
- [ ] Compilation to multiple architectures
